## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Python (v3.9+) & Poetry

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Create a .env file with your database URL
# Example: DATABASE_URL="mysql+pymysql://user:password@localhost/hisaab"
cp .env.example .env

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run the development server
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

The API will be live at `http://localhost:8000/docs` with interactive documentation.

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Create a .env file with the backend API URL
# Example: VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
cp .env.example .env
